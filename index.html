<h2>My place on the interwebs</h2>

<p>You probably want to <a href='/pages/posts.html'>see all the posts I've written</a>.</p>

<p>
  My current interests are:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <b>Creating efficient and stable web applications.</b>
        Web has an unparalleled compatibility between devices
        and a wealth of somewhat interoperable tooling.
        Creating maintainable and scalable applications is still challenging.
        The community is prone to fattally flawed fads and knowledge of computing theory
        is deeply lacking.
        However, there are many optimistic signs. The emergence of functional
        reactive paradigm, rising popularity of gradual type systems and languages
        compiled to JavaScript give hope for the future.

        <b>Type and Category Theory.</b>
        Types give a spine to the program, allowing it to handle complexity
        of real life with less breakdowns. They help with refactoring and make
        testing less of Yak shaving. Having an automated system that proves we've
        taken all the possibilities into account is liberating and allows the
        author to focus more on program logic.

        Theory itself is less applicable to real life programming
        than I would like to admit, but it is beautiful. It is the stuff I end up
        sinking hours into only to advance a couple pages in some paper.
        It helps with changing the mental model and showing
        reasons behind constructs we use. Most importantly, it gives us the tools
        for creating future better abstractions and algorithms.

        <b>Functional programming languages.</b> Because of the ease of abstracting
        away the common parts, functional programming languages result in applications
        thare are easier to reason about, better structured and can evolve over time.
        They make it clearer how the data flows in the program reducing the amount
        of bugs and improving maintainability of programs.
