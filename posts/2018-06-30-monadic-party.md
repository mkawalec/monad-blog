We ran [https://monadic.party](Monadic.Party), a summer school for beginner to intermediate Haskell programmers a month ago. We really wanted something like that to happen, to have a place where people from multiple backgrounds could share their knowledge in a welcoming setting during a longer event.

Conferences are very valuable and useful, but there's a great need to teach people topics more in depth. Providing a place where they would be not only exposed to a topic for an hour, but where they could deepen their understanding through more involved teaching sessions. Where they could do exercises and ask presenters questions that might not have been asked in a more formal setting where presenters change every hour.

Thanks to [https://x-team.com](X-Team) we were able to provide full scholarships to three people from around the world (Brazil, India and Germany) to come to the school. It was really important to us to allow people who wouldn't have been able to come otherwise to experience the school. The process for getting the scholarship was really competitive as we received over fifty applications for the three places. This had the unfortunate effect of us having to reject some excellent applications to arrive at the selection of final three.

## Running the summer school

Everything will break. The cameras will break, the microphones will break, coffee machines will definitely break. Of course SD cards will also break during the event, why wouldn't they? We've planned redundancy into all these aspects and where it wasn't enough, we were fortunately able to fix these issues quickly enough for them to not be a pain to the attendees. So a pat on the back here.

We will definitely have to record the talks through a HDMI proxy next time as we've experienced some pretty bad projector flicker that propagated into the recordings themselves. When running the Monadic Warsaw meetup, we could always elliminate the flicker through an appropriate framerate setting, but it didn't work this time.

We made really good choices with both the venue and hotel. They were really helpful with resolving any issues we had and served great food, accommodating for all the people with dietary requirements. The venue had provided extra electrical power and internet to make sure everyone can plug in their laptops without issues.

## Feedback received

The attendees rated the venue and the school highly. Lessons we have learnt for next year is to space the tracks a bit in the complexity level. Also we will devote the initial session to having the speakers pitch their talks for five minutes, which should give the attendees a better feeling for what the talks entail. It should also be easier to judge topic complexity for people who aren't exactly sure which track they fit in.

Some people complained about too lax moderation of some speakers, which we will also improve next year, by having one of the organizers in each of the rooms at all times.

## Summing up

The school went amazingly well, with way less issues than we expected. We trust everyone had a great time, learnt more about Haskell and made some great friends. See you all next year!
