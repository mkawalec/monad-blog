This year we ran the [https://monadic.party](monadic.party), a summer school for beginner to intermediate Haskell programmers. We really wanted something like that to happen, to have a place where people from multiple backgrounds could share the knowledge in a welcoming setting during a longer event.

We think conferences are very valuable and useful, but there's a great need to teach people topics more in depth. To give them a place where they would be not only exposed to a topic for an hour, but where they could deepen their understanding for a couple hours. Where they could do exercises and ask presenters questions that might not have been asked in a more formal setting.

# Lessons learnt

Everything will break. The cameras will break, the microphones will break, coffee machines will definitely break. We've planned redundancy into all these aspects and where it wasn't enough, we were fortunately able to fix these issues quickly enough for them to not be a pain to the attendees. So a pat on the back for this one.

We will definitely have to record the movies through HDMI next time as we've experienced some pretty bad projector flicker that propagated into the recordings themselves.
